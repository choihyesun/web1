Is everything just right
Don't want you thinking
that I'm in a hurry
I won't stay afraid
I had this vision that
has got me worried
Cause everyone wants someone
That's one cliche that's true
The sad truth's I want no one
Unless that someone's you
It looks like you
feels like you
<BR>smiles like you
I want someone just like you
true and through
I'm forever blue cause
there's no one else like
I hope that you're not mad
<P>You always said
you want a man of action
I'm not the hottest lad no
There's more than</p>
liking physical attraction
You've got your special someone
But between me and him guess who will
spending their whole life

waiting For someone just like you
That looks like you
it feels like you
it smiles like you
I need someone just like you
love me true
I'm forever blue cause
there's no one else like
I want you in my arms
I see you in my dreams
I'm gonna make you mine
as crazy as it seems
Just you yes you you
I need someone just like you
love me true
I'm forever blue cause
there's no one else
There's no one else
There's no one else
There's no one else
There's no one else
There's no one else
There's no one else
